# Examples

*Kalpana* has the two main capabilities lister below, but it also contains some functionality for pre- and post-process ADRCIRC-related files.

1. Visualization: convert *ADCIRC* output as geospatial vector data for visualization using QGIS or any similar GIS software.
2. Downscaling: transform the *ADCIRC* *maxele.63.nc* file to a higher-resolution raster (Rucker et. al 2021).<br>
2.1 Static: by considering small-scale topographic features.<br>
2.2 Head Loss: considering small-scale topographic features and energy loss due to bottom friction using a land cover dataset.<br><br>

The repo contains four sets of examples. In the first folder, we share a few Kalpana applications for working with ADCIRC-related files. The second showcases using Kalpana to export ADCIRC files as GIS vector files. The last two folders include examples of the Static and Head Loss downscaling methods.

For questions regarding the visualization or downscaling examples, please open an *Issue* or email tomascuevas@gmail.com.
